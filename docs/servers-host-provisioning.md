# Create a VM

## Create a configuration file
1. Call it `selfhosted-configs.txt`
2. Store user settings for later here
3. Example, we want to know that they used AWS so a future script can pick the right CLI

## Pick a hosting service
- AWS
- GCP
- DO
- Custom

### Add Host variable
> ANDREW: what format is easiest? JSON? TYPESCRIPT

## Pick a Domain hosting service 
- Cloudflare
- AWS

## Closing out
- Lets add the date the script was run.

## Encryption
- We can either:
  + encrypt the local file. What's best for that?
  + ask for their github account or repo, and store this there?
